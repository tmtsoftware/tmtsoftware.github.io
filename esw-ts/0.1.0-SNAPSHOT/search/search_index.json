There are two options to make this adapter automatically authenticate - login-required and check-sso. login-required will automatically authenticate if the user is already logged-in, otherwise it will display keycloak login page. check-sso will only authenticate if the user is already logged-in. If the user is not logged-in the browser will be redirected back to the application and remain unauthenticated.\ncsw-aas-js use check-sso to instantiate keycloak. It shows secure components if user is already logged in. If user is not authenticated Login component is rendered. If user clicks on login button it instantiates keyclock use login-required. This redirects user to keycloak login page. As access token has very short life span, at time of keycloak instantiation csw-aas-js also adds hooks to refresh token. This gives seamless user experience as user need not to login again.\nKeycloak adapter supports three authorization flows e.g. authorization code flow, implicit flow and hybrid flow. csw-aas-js has chosen hybrid flow as it has better performance than authorization code flow and unlike implicit flow, hybrid flow makes refresh token available to application. For more information please refer keyclok documentaion for authorization flows","title":"Keycloak"},{"location":"/technical/csw-aas-js.html#working-of-csw-aas-js","text":"When user opens web application in browser, AuthContextProvider component is mounted. Which does instantiation of keycloak client and initialize keycloak javascript adapter with check-sso and hybrid authorization flow. It also creates hooks for refreshing token when token is expired which silently refresh token resulting seamless user experience once logged in. After authentication is done via keycloak javascript adapter, AuthContext is extracted in domain model and this data is passed down the component tree using react context api. AuthContext gives handle to token, realm and resource roles, userInfo. Any component which want to use this information can become consumer of AuthContext. For example\nJavascript const { auth } = useContext(authContext)\nAccess token can be extracted from auth and it can be sent in Authorization header for calling secure api\nFor example -\nconst SampleComponent = () => {\n\n    const url = 'http://localhost:8080/secure-restful-service';\n    const auth = useContext(AuthContext) //AuthContext from csw-aas-js\n\n    const req = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    req.open('GET', url, true);\n    req.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\n    //extract token from auth context and set Authorization header\n    req.setRequestHeader('Authorization', 'Bearer ' + auth.token);\n\n    req.onreadystatechange = function () {\n        if (req.readyState == 4) {\n            if (req.status == 200) {\n                alert('Success');\n            } else if (req.status == 403) {\n                alert('Forbidden');\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    req.send();\n};\nFollowing diagram explains javascript application flow for making request to secure http api\nWhen user opens web application in browser, csw-aas-js checks if user is already logged in using check-sso mode. If user is not logged in then Login button is shown. When user clicks on login, user will be redirected to keyclok login page. This completes authentication process. Once authentication is done, AuthContextProvider extract AuthContext domain model and make it available to consumers of AuthContext. Protected react components can be shown based on information in AuthContext. For example, CreateConfig component can be shown only to users having config admin role. After the user is authenticated the application can make requests to RESTful services secured by Keycloak by including the bearer token in the Authorization header. This completed workflow for web application calling secure http endpoint.","title":"Working of csw-aas-js"},{"location":"/clients/command/command-service.html","text":"","title":"Command Service"},{"location":"/clients/command/command-service.html#command-service","text":"This client side service provides a handle to send commands to a component which is registered in location service.\nCommand service has following APIs:\nAPI Input args Returns validate ControlCommand ValidateResponse submit ControlCommand SubmitResponse oneway ControlCommand OnewayResponse query runId SubmitResponse queryFinal runId, timeoutInSeconds SubmitResponse subscribeCurrentState stateNames, onStateChangeCallback Subscription submitAndWait ControlCommand, timeoutInSeconds SubmitResponse submitAllAndWait ControlCommand[ ], timeoutInSeconds SubmitResponse[ ]","title":"Command Service"},{"location":"/clients/command/command-service.html#creation-of-command-service","text":"","title":"Creation of Command Service"},{"location":"/clients/command/command-service.html#pre-requisite","text":"In order to use command service for a specific component:\nThe component needs to be up and running behind the gateway server.
