It will look for an IRIS_Darknight script in the sequencer-script repository for each Sequencer.\nProvisioning is the deployment and starting of Sequence Components on machines that will be available for Sequencers. For a machine to be available for provisioning, it must have an Agent running.\nFor provisioning, Sequence Manager needs a provision configuration containing information on how many Sequence Components to start on running Agents/machines.
