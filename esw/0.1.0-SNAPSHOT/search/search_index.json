It has a set of states, and at any given time it could be in exactly one of those states. It supports a set of commands/messages, and on receiving those commands, it might choose to go in some other state.\nFollowing are the states supported by the Sequencer:\nIdle/Online: This is the default state of the Sequencer. A Sequencer is idle when it is up, but there’s no sequence under execution. A Sequencer can come to idle state from the following situations: when the Sequencer comes up for the first time when the Sequencer has finished execution of a sequence when the Sequencer was offline, and a goOnline command is sent Loaded: A Sequencer is in loaded state when a sequence is loaded for execution, but execution of the sequence hasn’t started. A separate start command is expected to start execution of the sequence. All sequence editor actions (for e.g. add, remove, reset) are accepted in this state. From this state, the Sequencer can go in InProgress state on receiving a start command, or it could go in offline state if goOffline command is sent. On receiving a reset command, which discards all the pending steps, the Sequencer will go to idle state. InProgress/Running: The Sequencer is in running state, only when it is executing a sequence. All sequence editor actions (for e.g. add, remove, reset) are accepted in this state. From running state, the Sequencer can go to idle state on completion of sequence, or it can be killed. In order to go offline from this state, the Sequencer has to go to idle and then offline. Offline: The Sequencer goes in offline state, only on receiving a goOffline command which can either come from an upstream sequencer, or from a user through the admin dashboard. In this state, only a few commands are excepted (for eg. goOnline, shutdown, status etc). Killed: This is the final state of the sequencer. The shutdown command can be sent in any state, hence a Sequencer can transition to this state from any other state.","title":"Sequencer State Transition"},{"location":"/sequencer/scripts/scripts.html","text":"","title":"Sequencer Script"},{"location":"/sequencer/scripts/scripts.html#sequencer-script","text":"FSM High Level DSL","title":"Sequencer Script"},{"location":"/sequencer/scripts/fsm.html","text":"","title":"FSM"},{"location":"/sequencer/scripts/fsm.html#fsm","text":"Scripts have ability to define and run Finite State Machine(FSM).

Logic in onGlobalError will be executed in case of all Handlers Failure including Command Handlers Failure. If onGlobalError handler is not provided by script then only logging of error cause is done by the framework.\nFollowing example shows usage of onGloablError\nKotlin // Scenario-1 onObserve handler fails\nonObserve(\"trigger-filter-wheel\") { command ->\n    val triggerStartEvent = ObserveEvent(\"esw.command\", \"trigger.start\", command(stringKey(name = \"triggerTime\")))\n    // publishEvent fails with EventServerNotAvailable which fails onObserve handler\n    // onGlobalError handler is called\n    // Sequence is terminated with failure.\n    publishEvent(triggerStartEvent)\n}\n\n// Scenario-2 onSetup handler fails - submit returns negative SubmitResponse\nonSetup(\"command-2\") { command ->\n    val assembly1 = Assembly(\"filter.wheel\", 5.seconds)\n\n    //Submit command to assembly return negative response. (error by default) onGlobalError handler is called.\n    // Sequence is terminated with failure.\n    assembly1.submit(command)\n}\n\n// Scenario-3\nonDiagnosticMode {startTime, hint ->\n    //publishEvent fails with EventServerNotAvailable\n    //onDiagnosticMode handler fails\n    //onGlobalError is called. Sequence execution continues.\n    publishEvent(ObserveEvent(\"esw.diagnostic.mode\", hint))\n}\n\nonGlobalError { error ->\n    val errorReason = stringKey(\"reason\").set(error.reason)\n    val observationEndEvent = ObserveEvent(\"esw.observation.end\", \"error\", errorReason)\n    publishEvent(observationEndEvent)\n}\nonError : This construct is specifically provided for Command Handlers Failure. onError block can be written specifically for each onSetup and onObserve handler. In case of failure, onError will be called first followed by onGlobalError and sequence will be terminated with failure. By default negative SubmitResponse is considered as error.\nFollowing example shows command level error handler along with global error handler. onError construct is available to handle failure of onSetup and onObserve command handler. In this example, submit to assembly return negative SubmitResponse triggers error handling mechanism.\nKotlin onSetup(\"submit-error-handling\") { command ->\n\n    /* =========== Scenario-1 (default) ============\n     * if submit returns negative response (which is considered as error by default)\n     * then current execution flow breaks and onError command handler gets invoked\n     * Hence, only Started (in case of long-running command) or Completed (in case of short running command) response is returned\n     */\n    val positiveSubmitResponse: CommandResponse.SubmitResponse = galilAssembly.submit(command)\n\n    //  First approach - using custom dsl (this is an alternative to kotlin pattern match using when)\n    positiveSubmitResponse\n            .onStarted { startedRes ->\n                val completedResponse = galilAssembly.queryFinal(startedRes.runId())\n                info(\"command completed with result: ${completedResponse.result}\")\n            }\n            .onCompleted { completed ->\n                info(\"command with ${completed.runId()} is completed with result: ${completed.result}\")\n            }\n\n    // Second approach - using kotlin pattern matching\n    when (positiveSubmitResponse) {\n        is CommandResponse.Started -> {\n            val completedResponse = galilAssembly.queryFinal(positiveSubmitResponse.runId())\n            info(\"command completed with response: $completedResponse\")\n        }\n        is CommandResponse.Completed -> info(\"command with ${positiveSubmitResponse.runId()} is completed\")\n        else -> finishWithError(\"Error starting WFS exposures: $positiveSubmitResponse\")\n    }\n\n}.onError { err ->\n    // onError is called when submit command to galil assembly fails\n    error(err.reason)\n}\nIf you don’t want to fail sequence in case of Command Service APIs while interacting with downstream Assembly/HCD (submit, query etc.) or Sequencer Command Service APIs while interacting with downstream Sequencer (submit, query etc.) then resumeOnError flag can be used.
