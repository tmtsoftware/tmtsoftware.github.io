# Service contracts

This page describes possible ways of accessing various services via HTTP/Websocket and sample JSON representation of request body, response body and error body. 

### Http endpoint

The url - `http://{{host}}:{{port}}/post-endpoint` can be used to access running service(e.g. location-service, command-service)
